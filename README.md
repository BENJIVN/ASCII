# Simple Conversion of Images to ASCII

In this project, I demonstrate how to convert normal images into ASCII art using the Python Imaging Library (PIL). This is a beginner-friendly project that I attempted to get familiar with Python. 

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to take any image and convert it into a representation made up of ASCII characters. By doing so, I gained experience with basic Python programming concepts, working with external libraries (specifically PIL), and manipulating images.

```bash
pip install Pillow
